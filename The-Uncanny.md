# The “Uncanny”[^1] #


## Ⅰ ##

It is only rarely that a psychoanalyst feels impelled to
investigate the subject of aesthetics even when aesthetics is
understood to mean not merely the theory of beauty, but the
theory of the qualities of feeling. He works in other planes of
mental life and has little to do with those subdued emotional
activities which, inhibited in their aims and dependent upon a
multitude of concurrent factors, usually furnish the material for
the study of aesthetics. But it does occasionally happen that he
has to interest himself in some particular province of that
subject; and then it usually proves to be a rather remote region
of it and one that has been neglected in standard works.

The subject of the “uncanny” is a province of this kind. It
undoubtedly belongs to all that is terrible—to all that arouses
dread and creeping horror; it is equally certain, too, that the
word is not always used in a clearly definable sense, so that it
tends to coincide with whatever excites dread. Yet we may expect
that it implies some intrinsic quality which justifies the use of
a special name. One is curious to know what this peculiar quality
is which allows us to distinguish as “uncanny” certain things
within the boundaries of what is “fearful.”

As good as nothing is to be found upon this subject in elaborate
treatises on aesthetics, which in general prefer to concern
themselves with what is beautiful, attractive and sublime, that
is with feelings of a positive nature, with the circumstances and
the objects that call them forth, rather than with the opposite
feelings of unpleasantness and repulsion. I know of only one
attempt in medico-psychological literature, a fertile but not
exhaustive paper by E. Jentsch.^[“Zur Psychologie des
Unheimlichen.”] But I must confess that I have not made a very
thorough examination of the bibliography, especially the foreign
literature, relating to this present modest contribution of mine,
for reasons which must be obvious at this time;^[[An allusion to
the European War only just concluded.—Trans.]] so
that my paper is presented to the reader without any claim of
priority.

In his study of the “uncanny,” Jentsch quite rightly lays stress
on the obstacle presented by the fact that people vary so very
greatly in their sensitivity to this quality of feeling. The
writer of the present contribution, indeed, must himself plead
guilty to a special obtuseness in the matter, where extreme
delicacy of perception would be more in place. It is long since
he has experienced or heard of anything which has given him an
uncanny impression, and he will be obliged to translate himself
into that state of feeling, and to awaken in himself the
possibility of it before he begins. Still, difficulties of this
kind make themselves felt powerfully in many other branches of
aesthetics; we need not on this account despair of finding
instances in which the quality in question will be recognized
without hesitation by most people.

Two courses are open to us at the start. Either we can find out
what meaning has come to be attached to the word “uncanny” in the
course of its history; or we can collect all those properties of
persons, things, sensations, experiences and situations which
arouse in us the feeling of uncanniness, and then infer the
unknown nature of the uncanny from what they all have in common.
I will say at once that both courses lead to the same result: the
“uncanny” is that class of the terrifying which leads back to
something long known to us, once very familiar. How this is
possible, in what circumstances the familiar can become uncanny
and frightening, I shall show in what follows. Let me also add
that my investigation was actually begun by collecting a number
of individual cases, and only later received confirmation after I
had examined what language could tell us. In this discussion,
however, I shall follow the opposite course.

The German word *unheimlich*^[Throughout this paper “uncanny” is
used as the English translation of *“unheimlich,”* literally
“unhomely” —Trans.] is obviously the opposite of
*heimlich*, *heimisch*, meaning “familiar,” “native,” “belonging to
the home”; and we are tempted to conclude that what is “uncanny”
is frightening precisely because it is *not* known and familiar.
Naturally not everything which is new and unfamiliar is
frightening, however; the relation cannot be inverted. We can
only say that what is novel can easily become frightening and
uncanny; some new things are frightening but not by any means
all. Something has to be added to what is novel and unfamiliar to
make it uncanny.

On the whole, Jentsch did not get beyond this relation of the
uncanny to the novel and unfamiliar. He ascribes the essential
factor in the production of the feeling of uncanniness to
intellectual uncertainty; so that the uncanny would always be
that in which one does not know where one is, as it were. The
better orientated in his environment a person is, the less
readily will he get the impression of something uncanny in regard
to the objects and events in it.

It is not difficult to see that this definition is incomplete,
and we will therefore try to proceed beyond the equation of
*unheimlich* with unfamiliar. We will first turn to other
languages. But foreign dictionaries tell us nothing new, perhaps
only because we speak a different language. Indeed, we get the
impression that many languages are without a word for this
particular variety of what is fearful.

I wish to express my indebtedness to Dr. Th. Reik for the
following excerpts:

LATIN: (K. E. Gorges, *Deutschlateinisches Wörterbuch, 1898*). Ein
*unheimlicher* Ort [an uncanny place]—*locus suspectus*; in
*unheimlicher* Nachtzeit [in the dismal night hours]—*intempesta
nocte*.

GREEK: (Rost’s and Schenki’s Lexikons). *Xenos* strange, foreign.

ENGLISH: (from dictionaries by Lucas, Bellow, Flügel,
Muret-Sanders). Uncomfortable, uneasy, gloomy, dismal, uncanny,
ghastly; (of a house) haunted; (of a man) a repulsive fellow.

FRENCH: (Sachs-Villatte). *Inquiétant*, *sinistre*, *lugubre*, *mal à
son aise*.

SPANISH: (Tollhausen, 1889). Sospechoso, *de mal aguëro*, *lugubre*,
*siniestro*.

The Italian and the Portuguese seem to content themselves with
words which we should describe as circumlocutions. In Arabic and
Hebrew “uncanny” means the same as “daemonic,” “gruesome.”

Let us therefore return to the German language. In Daniel
Sanders’ *Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache* (1860), the following
remarks^i^ [abstracted in translation] are found upon the word
*heimlich*; I have laid stress on certain passages by italicizing
them.

*Heimlich*, adj.: Ⅰ. Also *heimelich*, *heinielig*, belonging to the
house, not strange, familiar, tame, intimate, comfortable,
homely, etc.

\(a) (Obsolete) belonging to the house or the family, or regarded
as so belonging (cf. Latin *familiaris*): *Die Heimlichen*, the
members of the household; *Der heimliche Rat* [him to whom secrets
are revealed] Gen. ⅩⅬⅠ. 45; 2 Sam. ⅩⅩⅢ. 23; now more usually
*Geheimer Rat* [Privy Councillor], cf. *Heimlicher*.

\(b) Of animals: tame, companionable to man. As opposed to wild,
*e.g.* “Wild animals… that are trained to be *heimlich* and
accustomed to men.” “If these young creatures are brought up from
early days among men they become quite *heimlich*, friendly,” etc.

\(c) Friendly, intimate, homelike; the enjoyment of quiet content,
etc., arousing a sense of peaceful pleasure and security as in
one within the four walls of his house. “Is it still *heimlich* to
you in your country where strangers are felling your woods?” “She
did not feel all too *heimlich* with him.” “To destroy the
*Heimlichkeit* of the home.” “I could not readily find another spot
so intimate and *heimlich* as this.” “In quiet *Heinzlichkeit,
surrounded by close walls.*” “*A careful housewife, who knows how
to make a pleasing Heimlichkeit (Häuslichkeit)*^[From *Haus* =
house; *Häuslichkeit* = *domestic* life. —Trans.] out
of the smallest means.” “The protestant rulers do not feel… 
*heimlich* among their catholic subjects.” “When it grows *heimlich*
and still, and the evening quiet alone watches over your cell.”
“Quiet, lovely and *heimlich*, no place more fitted for her rest.”
“The in and out flowing waves of the currents dreamy and *heimlich*
as a cradle-song.” Cf. in especial *Unheimlich*. Among Swabian and
Swiss authors in especial, often as trisyllable: “*How heimelich*
it seemed again of an evening, back at home.” “The warm room and
the *heimelig* afternoon.” “Little by little they grew at ease and
*heimelig* among themselves.” “That which comes from afar… 
assuredly does not live quite *heimelig* (*heimatlich* [at home],
*freundnachbarlich* [in a neighborly way]) among the people.” “The
sentinel’s horn sounds so *heimelig* from the tower, and his voice
invites so hospitably.” *This form of the word ought to become
general in order to protect the word from becoming obsolete in
its good sense through an easy confusion with* Ⅱ. [see below].
‘*“The Zecks* [a family name] *are all “heimlich.”*’ ‘*“Heimlich”?
What do you understand by “heimlich”?*’ ‘*Well,… they are like
a buried spring or a dried-up pond. One cannot walk over it
without always having the feeling that water might come up there
again.’ ‘Oh, we call it “unheimlich”; you call it “heimlich.”
Well, what makes you think that there is something secret and
untrustworthy about this family?”*’ Gutzkow.

Ⅱ. Concealed, kept from sight, so that others do not get to know
about it, withheld from others, cf. *Geheim* [secret]; so also
*Heimlichkeit* for *Geheimnis* [secret]. To do something *heimlich*,
*i.e.* behind someone’s back; to steal away *heimlich*; *heimlich*
meetings and appointments; to look on with *heimlich* pleasure at
someone’s discomfiture; to sigh or weep *heimlich*; to behave
*heimlich*, as though there was something to conceal; *heimlich*
love, love-affair, sin; *heimlich* places (which good manners
oblige us to conceal). 1 Sam, Ⅴ. 6; “The *heimlich* chamber”
[privy]. 2 Kings Ⅹ. 27 etc.; “To throw into pits or
*Heimlichkeit*.” Led the steeds *heimlich* before Laomedon.” “As
secretive, *heimlich*, deceitful and malicious towards cruel
masters… as frank, open, sympathetic and helpful towards a
friend in misfortune.” “The *heimlich* art” (magic). “Where public
ventilation has to stop, there *heimlich* machinations begin.”
“Freedom is the whispered watchword of *heimlich* conspirators and
the loud battle-cry of professed revolutionaries.” “A holy,
*heimlich* effect.” “I have roots that are most *heimlich*, I am
grown in the deep earth.” “My heimlich pranks.” (Cf. *Heimtücke*
[mischief]). To discover, disclose, betray someone’s
*Heimlichkeiten*; “to concoct *Heimlichkeiten* behind my back.” Cf.
*Geheimnis*.

Compounds and especially also the opposite follow meaning Ⅰ.
(above): *Unheimlich*, uneasy, eerie, bloodcurdling; “Seeming
almost *unheimlich* and ‘ghostly’ to him.” “I had already long
since felt an *unheimlich*, even gruesome feeling.” “Feels an
*unheimlich* horror.” “*Unheimlich* and motionless like a
stone-image.” “The *unheimlich* mist called hill-fog.” “These pale
youths are *unheimlich* and are brewing heaven knows what
mischief.” “*‘Unheimlich’ is the name for everything that ought to
have remained… hidden and secret and has become visible,*”
Schelling. “To veil the divine, to surround it with a certain
*Unheimlichkeit*.”—*Unheimlich* is not often used as opposite to
meaning Ⅱ. (above).

What interests us most in this long extract is to find that among
its different shades of meaning the word *heimlich* exhibits one
which is identical with its opposite, *unheimlich*. What is
*heimlich* thus comes to be *unheimlich*. (Cf. the quotation from
Gutzkow: “We call it *unheimlich*; you call it *heimlich*.”) In
general we are reminded that the word *heimlich* is not
unambiguous, but belongs to two sets of ideas, which without
being contradictory are yet very different: on the one hand, it
means that which is familiar and congenial, and on the other,
that which is concealed and kept out of sight. The word
*unheimlich* is only used customarily, we are told, as the contrary
of the first signification, and not of the second. Sanders tells
us nothing concerning a possible genetic connection between these
two sorts of meanings. On the other hand, we notice that
Schelling says something which throws quite a new light on the
concept of the “uncanny,” one which we had certainly not awaited.
According to him everything is uncanny that ought to have
remained hidden and secret, and yet comes to light.

Some of the doubts that have thus arisen are removed if we
consult Grimm’s dictionary.^Ⅱ^

We read:

*Heimlich*; adj. and adv. *vernaculus*, *occultus*; MHG. heimelîch,
heimlîch.

P. 874. In a slightly different sense: "I feel *heimlich*, well,
free from fear."…

\(b) *Heimlich*, also in the sense of a place free from ghostly
influences… familiar, friendly, intimate.

[4.]{} *From the idea of “homelike,” “belonging to the house,” the
further idea is developed of something withdrawn from the eyes of
others, something concealed, secret, and this idea is expanded in
many ways*…

P. 876. “On the left bank of the lake there lies a meadow
*heimlich* in the wood.” Schiller, *Tell*… Poetic licence,
rarely so used in modern speech… In conjunction with a verb
expressing the act of concealing: “In the secret of his
tabernacle he shall hide me (*heimlich*).” Ps. ⅩⅩⅦ. 5… 
*Heimlich* places in the human body, *pudenda*… “the men that
died not were smitten” (on their *heimlich* parts). 1 Samuel Ⅴ. 12.

\(c) Officials who give important advice which has to be kept
secret in matters of state are called *heimlich* councillors; the
adjective, according to modern usage, having been replaced by
*geheim* [secret]… ‘Pharaoh called Joseph’s name “him to whom
secrets are revealed”’ (*heimlich* councillor). Gen. ⅩⅬⅠ. 45.

P. 878. 6. *Heimlich*, as used of knowledge, mystic, allegorical: a
*heimlich* meaning, *mysticus*, *divinus*, *occultus*, *figuratus*.

P. 878. *Heimlich* in a different sense, as withdrawn from
knowledge, unconscious:… *Heimlich* also has the meaning of
that which is obscure, inaccessible to knowledge… “Do you
not see? They do not trust me; they fear the *heimlich* face of the
Duke of Friedland.” *Wallensteins Lager*, Act. 2.

[9.]{} *The notion of something hidden and dangerous, which is
expressed in the last paragraph, is still further developed, so
that “heimlich” comes to have the meaning usually ascribed to
“unheimlich.”* Thus: “At times I feel like a man who walks in the
night and believes in ghosts; every corner is *heimlich* and full
of terrors for him.” Klinger.

Thus *heimlich* is a word the meaning of which develops towards an
ambivalence, until it finally coincides with its opposite,
*unheimlich*. *Unheimlich* is in some way or other a sub-species of
*heimlich*. Let us retain this discovery, which we do not yet
properly understand, alongside of Schelling’s definition of the
“uncanny.” Then if we examine individual instances of
uncanniness, these indications will become comprehensible to us.

## Ⅱ ##

In proceeding to review those things, persons, impressions,
events and situations which are able to arouse in us a feeling of
the uncanny in a very forcible and definite form, the first
requirement is obviously to select a suitable example to start
upon. Jentsch has taken as a very good instance “doubts whether
an apparently animate being is really alive; or conversely,
whether a lifeless object might not be in fact animate”; and he
refers in this connection to the impression made by wax-work
figures, artificial dolls and automatons. He adds to this class
the uncanny effect of epileptic seizures and the manifestations
of insanity, because these excite in the spectator the feeling
that automatic, mechanical processes are at work, concealed
beneath the ordinary appearance of animation. Without entirely
accepting the author’s view, we will take it as a starting-point
for our investigation because it leads us on to consider a writer
who has succeeded better than anyone else in producing uncanny
effects.

Jentsch says: “In telling a story, one of the most successful
devices for easily creating uncanny effects is to leave the
reader in uncertainty whether a particular figure in the story is
a human being or an automaton; and to do it in such a way that
his attention is not directly focused upon his uncertainty, so
that he may not be urged to go into the matter and clear it up
immediately, since that, as we have said, would quickly dissipate
the peculiar emotional effect of the thing. Hoffmann has
repeatedly employed this psychological artifice with success in
his fantastic narratives.”

This observation, undoubtedly a correct one, refers primarily to
the story of “The Sand-Man” in Hoffmann’s
*Nachtstücken*,^[Hoffmann’s *Similiche Werke*, Grisebach
Edition, 3. [A translation of 'The Sand-Man' is included in
*Eight Tales of Hoffmann*, translated by J. M. Cohen, London, Pan
Books, 1952.]] which contains the original of Olympia, the doll
in the first act of Offenbach’s opera, *Tales of Hoffmann*. But I
cannot think—and I hope that most readers of the story will agree
with me—that the theme of the doll, Olympia, who is to all
appearances a living being, is by any means the only element to
be held responsible for the quite unparalleled atmosphere of
uncanniness which the story evokes; or, indeed, that it is the
most important among them. Nor is this effect of the story
heightened by the fact that the author himself treats the episode
of Olympia with a faint touch of satire and uses it to make fun
of the young man’s idealization of his mistress. The main theme
of the story is, on the contrary, something different, something
which gives its name to the story, and which is always
re-introduced at the critical moment: it is the theme of the
“Sand-Man” who tears out children’s eyes.

This fantastic tale begins with the childhood-recollections of the
student Nathaniel: in spite of his present happiness, he cannot
banish the memories associated with the mysterious and terrifying
death of the father he loved. On certain evenings his mother used
to send the children to bed early, warning them that “the
Sand-Man was coming”; and sure enough Nathaniel would not fail to
hear the heavy tread of a visitor with whom his father would then
be occupied that evening. When questioned about the Sand-Man, his
mother, it is true, denied that such a person existed except as a
form of speech; but his nurse could give him more definite
information: “He is a wicked man who comes when children won’t go
to bed, and throws handfuls of sand in their eyes so that they
jump out of their heads all bleeding. Then he puts the eyes in a
sack and carries them off to the moon to feed his children. They
sit up there in their nest, and their beaks are hooked like owls’
beaks, and they use them to peck up naughty boys’ and girls’ eyes
with.”

Although little Nathaniel was sensible and old enough not to
believe in such gruesome attributes to the figure of the
Sand-Man, yet the dread of him became fixed in his breast. He
determined to find out what the Sand-Man looked like; and one
evening, when the Sand-Man was again expected, he hid himself in
his father’s study. He recognized the visitor as the lawyer
Coppelius, a repulsive person of whom the children were
frightened when he occasionally came to a meal; and he now
identified this Coppelius with the dreaded Sand-Man. Concerning
the rest of the scene, Hoffmann already leaves us in doubt
whether we are witnessing the first delirium of the
panic-stricken boy, or a succession of events which are to be
regarded in the story as being real. His father and the guest
begin to busy themselves at a hearth with glowing flames. The
little eavesdropper hears Coppelius call out, “Here with your
eyes!” and betrays himself by screaming aloud; Coppelius seizes
him and is about to drop grains of red-hot coal out of the fire
into his eyes, so as to cast them out on the hearth. His father
begs him off and saves his eyes. After this the boy falls into a
deep swoon; and a long illness followed upon his experience.
Those who lean towards a rationalistic interpretation of the
Sand-Man will not fail to recognize in the child’s phantasy the
continued influence of his nurse’s story. The grains of sand that
are to be thrown into the child’s eyes turn into red-hot grains
of coal out of the flames; and in both cases they are meant to
make his eyes jump out. In the course of another visit of the
Sand-Man’s, a year later, his father was killed in his study by
an explosion. The lawyer Coppelius vanished from the place
without leaving a trace behind.

Nathaniel, now a student, believes that he has recognized this
childhood’s phantom of horror in an itinerant optician, an
Italian called Giuseppe Coppola. This man had offered him
barometers for sale in his university town and when Nathaniel
refused had added: “Eh, not barometers, not barometers—also got
fine eyes, beautiful eyes.” The student’s terror was allayed on
finding that the proffered eyes were only harmless spectacles,
and he bought a pocket telescope from Coppola. With its aid he
looks across into Professor Spalanzani’s house opposite and there
spies Spalanzani’s beautiful, but strangely silent and motionless
daughter, Olympia. He soon falls in love with her so violently
that he quite forgets his clever and sensible betrothed on her
account. But Olympia was an automaton whose works Spalanzani had
made, and whose eyes Coppola, the Sand-Man, had put in. The
student surprises the two men quarrelling over their handiwork.
The optician carries off the wooden eyeless doll; and the
mechanician, Spalanzani, takes up Olympia’s bleeding eye-balls
from the ground and throws them at Nathaniel’s breast, saying
that Coppola had stolen them from him (Nathaniel). Nathaniel
succumbs to a fresh attack of madness, and in his delirium his
recollection of his father’s death is mingled with this new
experience. He cries, “Faster—faster— faster—rings of fire—rings
of fire! Whirl about, rings of fire—round and round! Wooden doll,
ho! lovely wooden doll, whirl about——,” then falls upon the
professor, Olympia’s so-called father, and tries to strangle him.

Rallying from a long and serious illness, Nathaniel seemed at
last to have recovered. He was going to marry his betrothed with
whom he was reconciled. One day he was walking through the town
and marketplace, where the high tower of the Town-Hall threw its
huge shadow. On the girl’s suggestion they mounted the tower,
leaving her brother, who was walking with them, down below. Up
there, Clara’s attention is drawn to a curious object coming
along the street. Nathaniel looks at this thing through Coppola’s
spyglass, which he finds in his pocket, and falls into a new fit
of madness. Shouting out, “Whirl about, my wooden doll!” he tries
to fling the girl into the depths below. Her brother, brought to
her side by her cries, rescues her and hastens down to safety
with her. Up above, the raving man rushes round, shrieking “Rings
of fire, whirl about!”—words whose origin we know. Among the
people who begin to gather below there comes forward the figure
of the lawyer Coppelius, suddenly returned. We may suppose it was
his approach, seen through the telescope, that threw Nathaniel
into his madness. People want to go up and overpower the madman,
but Coppelius^[Frau Dr. Rank has pointed out the association of
the name with “Coppella” = crucible, connecting it with the
chemical operations that caused the father’s death; and also with
“coppo” = eye-socket.] laughs and says, “Wait a bit; he’ll come
down of himself.” Nathaniel suddenly stands still, catches sight
of Coppelius, and with a wild shriek “Yes! ‘Fine eyes-beautiful
eyes,’” flings himself down over the parapet. No sooner does he
lie on the paving-stones with a shattered skull than the Sand-Man
vanishes in the throng.

This short summary leaves, I think, no doubt that the feeling of
something uncanny is directly attached to the figure of the
Sand-Man, that is, to the idea of being robbed of one’s eyes; and
that Jentsch’s point of an intellectual uncertainty has nothing
to do with this effect. Uncertainty whether an object is living
or inanimate, which we must admit in regard to the doll Olympia,
is quite irrelevant in connection with this other, more striking
instance of uncanniness. It is true that the writer creates a
kind of uncertainty in us in the beginning by not letting us
know, no doubt purposely, whether he is taking us into the real
world or into a purely fantastic one of his own creation. He has
admitted the right to do either; and if he chooses to stage his
action in a world peopled with spirits, demons and ghosts, as
Shakespeare does in *Hamlet*, in *Macbeth* and, in a different sense,
in *The Tempest* and *A Midsummer-Night’s Dream*, we must bow to his
decision and treat his setting as though it were real for as long
as we put ourselves into his hands. But this uncertainty
disappears in the course of Hoffmann’s story, and we perceive
that he means to make us, too, look through the fell Coppola’s
glasses—perhaps, indeed, that he himself once gazed through such
an instrument. For the conclusion of the story makes it quite
clear that Coppola the optician really is the lawyer Coppelius
and thus also the Sand-Man.

There is no question, therefore, of any “intellectual
uncertainty”; we know now that we are not supposed to be looking
on at the products of a madman’s imagination behind which we,
with the superiority of rational minds, are able to detect the
sober truth; and yet this knowledge does not lessen the
impression of uncanniness in the least degree. The theory of
“intellectual uncertainty” is thus incapable of explaining that
impression.

We know from psychoanalytic experience, however, that this fear
of damaging or losing one’s eyes is a terrible fear of childhood.
Many adults still retain their apprehensiveness in this respect,
and no bodily injury is so much dreaded by them as an injury to
the eye. We are accustomed to say, too, that we will treasure a
thing as the apple of our eye. A study of dreams, phantasies and
myths has taught us that a morbid anxiety connected with the eyes
and with going blind is often enough a substitute for the dread
of castration. In blinding himself, Oedipus, that mythical
law-breaker, was simply carrying out a mitigated form of the
punishment of castration—the only punishment that according to
the *lex talionis* was fitted for him. We may try to reject the
derivation of fears about the eye from the fear of castration on
rationalistic grounds, and say that it is very natural that so
precious an organ as the eye should be guarded by a proportionate
dread; indeed, we might go further and say that the fear of
castration itself contains no other significance and no deeper
secret than a justifiable dread of this kind. But this view does
not account adequately for the substitutive relation between the
eye and the male member which is seen to exist in dreams and
myths and phantasies; nor can it dispel the impression one gains
that it is the threat of being castrated in especial which
excites a peculiarly violent and obscure emotion, and that this
emotion is what first gives the idea of losing other organs its
intense colouring. All further doubts are removed when we get the
details of their “castration-complex” from the analyses of
neurotic patients, and realize its immense importance in their
mental life.

Moreover, I would not recommend any opponent of the
psychoanalytic view to select precisely the story of the Sand-Man
upon which to build his case that morbid anxiety about the eyes
has nothing to do with the castration-complex. For why does
Hoffmann bring the anxiety about eyes into such intimate
connection with the father’s death? And why does the Sand-Man
appear each time in order to interfere with love? He divides the
unfortunate Nathaniel from his betrothed and from her brother,
his best friend; he destroys his second object of love, Olympia,
the lovely doll; and he drives him into suicide at the moment
when he has won back his Clara and is about to be happily united
to her. Things like these and many more seem arbitrary and
meaningless in the story so long as we deny all connection
between fears about the eye and castration; but they become
intelligible as soon as we replace the Sand-Man by the dreaded
father at whose hands castration is awaited.[^8]

We shall venture, therefore, to refer the uncanny effect of the
Sand-Man to the child’s dread in relation to its
castration-complex. But having gained the idea that we can take
this infantile factor to account for feelings of uncanniness, we
are drawn to examine whether we can apply it to other instances
of uncanny things. We find in the story of the Sand-Man the other
theme upon which Jentsch lays stress, of a doll that appears to
be alive. Jentsch believes that a particularly favourable
condition for awakening uncanny sensations is created when there
is intellectual uncertainty whether an object is alive or not,
and when an animate object becomes too much like an animate one.
Now, dolls happen to be rather closely connected with infantile
life. We remember that in their early games children do not
distinguish at all sharply between living and lifeless objects,
and that they are especially fond of treating their dolls like
live people. In fact I have occasionally heard a woman patient
declare that even at the age of eight she had still been
convinced that her dolls would be certain to come to life if she
were to look at them in a particular way, with as concentrated a
gaze as possible. So that here, too, it is not difficult to
discover a factor from childhood; but curiously enough, while the
Sand-Man story deals with the excitation of an early childhood
fear, the idea of a “living doll” excites no fear at all; the
child had no fear of its doll coming to life, it may even have
desired it. The source of the feeling of an uncanny thing would
not, therefore, be an infantile fear in this case, but rather an
infantile wish or even only an infantile belief. There seems to
be a contradiction here; but perhaps it is only a complication,
which may be helpful to us later on.

Hoffmann is in literature the unrivalled master of conjuring up
the uncanny. His *Elixire des Teufels* [The Devil’s Elixir]
contains a mass of themes to which one is tempted to ascribe the
uncanny effect of the narrative; but it is too obscure and
intricate a story to venture to summarize. Towards the end of the
book the reader is told the facts, hitherto concealed
from him, from which the action springs; with the result, not
that he is at last enlightened, but that he falls into a state of
complete bewilderment The author has piled up too much of a kind;
one’s comprehension of the whole suffers as a result, though not
the impression it makes. We must content ourselves with selecting
those themes of uncanniness which are most prominent, and seeing
whether we can fairly trace then also back to infantile sources.
These themes are all concerned with the idea of a “double” in
every shape and degree, with persons, therefore, who are to be
considered identical by reason of looking alike; Hoffmann
accentuates this relation by transferring mental processes from
the one person to the other—what we should call telepathy—so that
the one possesses knowledge, feeling and experience in common
with the other, identifies himself with another person, so that
his self becomes confounded, or the foreign self is substituted
for his own—in other words, by doubling, dividing and
interchanging the self. And finally there is the constant
recurrence of similar situations, a same face, or
character-trait, or twist of fortune, or a same crime, or even a
same name recurring throughout several consecutive generations.

The theme of the “double” has been very thoroughly treated by
Otto Rank.^[“Der Doppelgänger.”] He has gone into the connections
the “double” has with reflections in mirrors, with shadows,
guardian spirits, with the belief in the soul and the fear of
death; but he also lets in a flood of light on the astonishing
evolution of this idea. For the “double” was originally an
insurance against destruction to the ego, an “energetic denial of
the power of death,” as Rank says; and probably the “immortal”
soul was the first “double” of the body. This invention of
doubling as a preservation against extinction has its counterpart
in the language of dreams, which is fond of representing
castration by a doubling or multiplication of the genital symbol;
the same desire spurred on the ancient Egyptians to the art of
making images of the dead in some lasting material. Such ideas,
however, have sprung from the soil of unbounded self-love, from
the primary narcissism which holds sway in the mind of the child
as in that of primitive man; and when this stage has been left
behind the double takes on a different aspect. From having been
an assurance of immortality, he becomes the ghastly harbinger of
death.

The idea of the “double” does not necessarily disappear with the
passing of the primary narcissism, for it can receive fresh
meaning from the later stages of development of the ego. A
special faculty is slowly formed there, able to oppose the rest
of the ego, with the function of observing and criticizing the
self and exercising a censorship within the mind, and this we
become aware of as our “conscience.” In the pathological case of
delusions of being watched this mental institution becomes
isolated, dissociated from the ego, and discernible to a
physician’s eye. The fact that a faculty of this kind exists,
which is able to treat the rest of the ego like an object—the
fact, that is, that man is capable of self-observation—renders it
possible to invest the old idea of a “double” with a new meaning
and to ascribe many things to it, above all, those things which
seem to the new faculty of self-criticism to belong to the old
surmounted narcissism of the earliest period of all.^[I cannot
help thinking that when poets complain that two souls dwell
within the human breast, and when popular psychologists talk of
the splitting of the ego in an individual, they have some notion
of this division (which relates to the sphere of ego-psychology)
between the critical faculty and the rest of the ego, and not of
the antithesis discovered by psychoanalysis between the ego and
what is unconscious and repressed. It is true that the
distinction is to some extent effaced by the circumstance that
derivatives of what is repressed are foremost among the things
reprehended by the ego-criticizing faculty.]

But it is not only this narcissism, offensive to the
ego-criticizing faculty, which may be incorporated in the idea of
a double. There are also all those unfulfilled but possible
futures to which we still like to cling in phantasy, all those
strivings of the ego which adverse external circumstances have
crushed, and all our suppressed acts of volition which nourish in
us the illusion of Free Will.^[In Ewers’ Der Student von Prag,
which furnishes the starting-point of Rank’s study on the
“double,” the hero has promised his beloved not to kill his
antagonist in a duel. But on his way to the duelling-ground he
meets his “double,” who has already killed his rival.]

But, after having thus considered the manifest motivation of the
figure of a “double,” we have to admit that none of it helps us
to understand the extraordinarily strong feeling of something
uncanny that pervades the conception; and our knowledge of
pathological mental processes enables us to add that nothing in
the content arrived at could account for that impulse towards
self-protection which has caused the ego to project such a
content outward as something foreign to itself. The quality of
uncanniness can only come from the circumstance of the “double”
being a creation dating back to a very early mental stage, long
since left behind, and one, no doubt, in which it wore a more
friendly aspect. The “double” has become a vision of terror, just
as after the fall of their religion the gods took on daemonic
shapes.^[Heine, *Die Götter im Exil.*]

It is not difficult to judge, on the same lines as his theme of
the “double,” the other forms of disturbance in the ego made use
of by Hoffmann. They are a harking-back to particular phases in
the evolution of the self-regarding feeling, a regression to a
time when the ego was not yet sharply differentiated from the
external world and from other persons. I believe that these
factors are partly responsible for the impression of the uncanny,
although it is not easy to isolate and determine exactly their
share of it.

That factor which consists in a recurrence of the same
situations, things and events, will perhaps not appeal to
everyone as a source of uncanny feeling. From what I have
observed, this phenomenon does undoubtedly, subject to certain
conditions and combined with certain circumstances, awaken an
uncanny feeling, which recalls that sense of helplessness
sometimes experienced in dreams. Once, as I was walking through
the deserted streets of a provincial town in Italy which was
strange to me, on a hot summer afternoon, I found myself in a
quarter the character of which could not long remain in doubt.
Nothing but painted women were to be seen at the windows of the
small houses, and I hastened to leave the narrow street at the
next turning. But after having wandered about for a while without
being directed, I suddenly found myself back in the same street,
where my presence was now beginning to excite attention. I
hurried away once more, but only to arrive yet a third time by
devious paths in the same place. Now, however, a feeling overcame
me which I can only describe as uncanny, and I was glad enough to
abandon my exploratory walk and get straight back to the piazza I
had left a short while before. Other situations having in common
with my adventure an involuntary return to the same situation,
but which differ radically from it in other respects, also result
in the same feeling of helplessness and of something uncanny. As,
for instance, when one is lost in a forest in high altitudes,
caught, we will suppose, by the mountain mist, and when every
endeavor to find the marked or familiar path ends again and again
in a return to one and the same spot, recognizable by some
particular landmark. Or when one wanders about in a dark, strange
room, looking for the door or the electric switch, and collides
for the hundredth time with the same piece of furniture—a
situation which, indeed, has been made irresistibly comic by Mark
Twain, through the wild extravagance of his narration.

Taking another class of things, it is easy to see that here, too,
it is only this factor of involuntary repetition which surrounds
with an uncanny atmosphere what would otherwise be innocent
enough, and forces upon us the idea of something fateful and
unescapable where otherwise we should have spoken of “chance”
only. For instance, we of course attach no importance to the
event when we give up a coat and get a cloakroom ticket with the
number, say, 62; or when we find that our cabin on board ship is
numbered
62. But the impression is altered if two such events, each in
itself indifferent, happen close together, if we come across the
number 62 several times in a single day, or if we begin to notice
that everything which has a number— addresses, hotel-rooms,
compartments in railway-trains— always has the same one, or one
which at least contains the same figures. We do feel this to be
“uncanny,” and unless a man is utterly hardened and proof against
the lure of superstition he will be tempted to ascribe a secret
meaning to this obstinate recurrence of a number, taking it,
perhaps, as an indication of the span of life allotted to him. Or
take the case that one is engaged at the time in reading the
works of Hering, the famous physiologist, and then receives
within the space of a few days two letters from two different
countries, each from a person called Hering; whereas one has
never before had any dealings with anyone of that name. Not long
ago an ingenious scientist attempted to reduce coincidences of
this kind to certain laws, and so deprive them of their uncanny
effect.^[P. Kammerer, *Das Gesetz der Serie* (Vienna, 1919).] I
will not venture to decide whether he has succeeded or not.

How exactly we can trace back the uncanny effect of such
recurrent similarities to infantile psychology is a question I
can only lightly touch upon in these pages; and I must refer the
reader instead to another pamphlet,^[*Beyond the
Pleasure-Principle*.—Trans.] now ready for
publication, in which this has been gone into in detail, but in a
different connection. It must be explained that we are able to
postulate the principle of a *repetition-compulsion* in the
unconscious mind, based upon instinctual activity and probably
inherent in the very nature of the instincts—a principle powerful
enough to overrule the pleasure-principle, lending to certain
aspects of the mind their daemonic character, and still very
clearly expressed in the tendencies of small children; a
principle, too, which is responsible for a part of the course
taken by the analyses of neurotic patients. Taken in all, the
foregoing prepares us for the discovery that whatever reminds us
of this inner *repetition-compulsion* is perceived as uncanny.

Now, however, it is time to turn from these aspects of the
matter, which are in any case difficult to decide upon, and look
for undeniable instances of the uncanny, in the hope that
analysis of them will settle whether our hypothesis is a valid
one.

In the story of “The Ring of Polycrates,” the guest turns away
from his friend with horror because he sees that his every wish
is at once fulfilled, his every care immediately removed by
kindly fate. His host has become “uncanny” to him. His own
explanation, that the too fortunate man has to fear the envy of
the gods, seems still rather obscure to us; its meaning is veiled
in mythological language. We will therefore turn to another
example in a less grandiose setting. In the case history of an
obsessional neurotic,^[Freud, “Notes upon a Case of Obessional
Neurosis,” *Three Case Histories*, Collier Books edition BS
191V.] I have described how the patient once stayed in a
hydropathic establishment and benefited greatly by it. He had the
good sense, however, to attribute his improvement not to the
therapeutic properties of the water, but to the situation of his
room, which immediately adjoined that of very amiable nurse. So
on his second visit to the establishment he asked for the same
room but was told that it was already occupied by an old
gentleman, whereupon he gave vent to his annoyance in the words
“Well, I hope he’ll have a stroke and die.” A fortnight later the
old gentleman really did have a stroke. My patient thought this
an “uncanny” experience. And that impression of uncanniness would
have been stronger still if less time had elapsed between his
exclamation and the untoward event, or if he had been able to
produce innumerable similar coincidences. As a matter of fact, he
had no difficulty in producing coincidences of this sort, but
then not only he but all obsessional neurotics I have observed
are able to relate analogous experiences. They are never
surprised when they invariably run up against the person they
have just been thinking of, perhaps for the first time for many
months. If they say one day “I haven’t had news of so-and-so for
a long time,” they will be sure to get a letter from him the next
morning. And an accident or a death will rarely take place
without having cast its shadow before on their minds. They are in
the habit of mentioning this state of affairs in the most modest
manner, saying that they have “presentiments” which “usually”
come true.

One of the most uncanny and wide-spread forms of superstition is
the dread of the evil eye.^[Seligmann, the Hamburg
ophthalmologist, has made a thorough study of this superstition
in his *Der böse Blick und Verwandtes* (Berlin, 1910).] There
never seems to have been any doubt about the source of this
dread. Whoever possesses something at once valuable and fragile
is afraid of the envy of others, in that he projects on to them
the envy he would have felt in their place. A feeling like this
betrays itself in a look even though it is not put into words;
and when a man attracts the attention of others by noticeable,
and particularly by unattractive, attributes, they are ready to
believe that his envy is rising to more than usual heights and
that this intensity in it will convert it into effective action.
What is feared is thus a secret intention of harming someone, and
certain signs are taken to mean that such an intention is capable
of becoming an act.

These last examples of the uncanny are to be referred to that
principle in the mind which I have called “omnipotence of
thoughts,” taking the name from an expression used by one of my
patients. And now we find ourselves on well-known ground. Our
analysis of instances of the uncanny has led us back to the old,
animistic conception of the universe, which was characterized by
the idea that the world was peopled with the spirits of human
beings, and by the narcissistic overestimation of subjective
mental processes (such as the belief in the omnipotence of
thoughts, the magical practices based upon this belief, the
carefully proportioned distribution of magical powers or “mana”
among various outside persons and things), as well as by all
those other figments of the imagination with which man, in the
unrestricted narcissism of that stage of development, strove to
withstand the inexorable laws of reality. It would seem as though
each one of us has been through a phase of individual development
corresponding to that animistic stage in primitive men, that none
of us has traversed it without preserving certain traces of it
which can be re-activated, and that everything which now strikes
us as “uncanny” fulfils the condition of stirring those vestiges
of animistic mental activity within us and bringing them to
expression.^[Cf. my book *Totem und Tabu*, part Ⅲ., “Animismus,
Magie und Allmacht der Gedanken”; also the footnote on p. 7 of
the same book: “It would appear that we invest with a feeling of
uncanniness those impressions which lend support to a belief in
the omnipotence of thoughts, and to the animistic attitude of
mind, at a time when our judgment has already rejected these same
beliefs.”]

This is the place now to put forward two considerations which, I
think, contain the gist of this short study. In the first place,
if psychoanalytic theory is correct in maintaining that every
emotional affect, whatever its quality, is transformed by
repression into morbid anxiety, then among such cases of anxiety
there must be a class in which the anxiety can be shown to come
from something repressed which *recurs*. This class of morbid
anxiety would then be no other than what is uncanny, irrespective
of whether it originally aroused dread or some other affect. In
the second place, if this is indeed the secret nature of the
uncanny, we can understand why the usage of speech has extended
das *Heimliche* into its opposite *das Unheimliche*;^[Cf. abstract on
p. 23.] for this uncanny is in reality nothing new or foreign,
but something familiar and old—established in the mind that has
been estranged only by the process of repression. This reference
to the factor of repression enables us, furthermore, to
understand Schelling’s definition of the uncanny as something
which ought to have been kept concealed but which has
nevertheless come to light.

It only remains for us to test our new hypothesis on one or two
more examples of the uncanny.

Many people experience the feeling in the highest degree in
relation to death and dead bodies, to the return of the dead, and
to spirits and ghosts. As we have seen, many languages in use
today can only render the German expression “an *unheimliches*
house” by “a *haunted* house.” We might indeed have begun our
investigation with this example, perhaps the most striking of
all, of something uncanny, but we refrained from doing so because
the uncanny in it is too much mingled with and in part covered by
what is purely gruesome. There is scarcely any other matter,
however, upon which our thoughts and feelings have changed so
little since the very earliest times, and in which discarded
forms have been so completely preserved under a thin disguise, as
that of our relation to death. Two things account for our
conservatism: the strength of our original emotional reaction to
it, and the insufficiency of our scientific knowledge about it.
Biology has not yet been able to decide whether death is the
inevitable fate of every living being or whether it is only a
regular but yet perhaps avoidable event in life. It is true that
the proposition “All men are mortal” is paraded in text-books of
logic as an example of a generalization, but no human being
really grasps it, and our unconscious has as little use now as
ever for the idea of its own mortality. Religions continue to
dispute the undeniable fact of the death of each one of us and to
postulate a life after death; civil governments still believe
that they cannot maintain moral order among the living if they do
not uphold this prospect of a better life after death as a
recompense for earthly existence. In our great cities, placards
announce lectures which will tell us how to get into touch with
the souls of the departed; and it cannot be denied that many of
the most able and penetrating minds among our scientific men have
come to the conclusion, especially towards the close of their
lives, that a contact of this kind is not utterly impossible.
Since practically all of us still think as savages do on this
topic, it is no matter for surprise that the primitive fear of
the dead is still so strong within us and always ready to come to
the surface at any opportunity. Most likely our fear still
contains the old belief that the deceased becomes the enemy of
his survivor and wants to carry him off to share his new life
with him. Considering our unchanged attitude towards death, we
might rather inquire what has become of the repression, that
necessary condition for enabling a primitive feeling to recur in
the shape of an uncanny effect. But repression is there, too. All
so-called educated people have ceased to believe, officially at
any rate, that the dead can become visible as spirits, and have
hedged round any such appearances with improbable and remote
circumstances; their emotional attitude towards their dead,
moreover, once a highly dubious and ambivalent one, has been
toned down in the higher strata of the mind into a simple feeling
of reverence.^[Cf. *Totem und Tabu*: “Das Tabu und die
Ambivalenz.”]

We have now only a few more remarks to add, for animism, magic
and witchcraft, the omnipotence of thoughts, man’s attitude to
death, involuntary repetition and the castration-complex comprise
practically all the factors which turn something fearful into an
uncanny thing.

We also call a living person uncanny, usually when we ascribe
evil motives to him. But that is not all; we must not only credit
him with bad intentions but must attribute to these intentions
capacity to achieve their aim in virtue of certain special
powers. A good instance of this is the “Gettatore,” that uncanny
figure of Roman superstition which Schaeffer, with intuitive
poetic feeling and profound psychoanalytic knowledge, has
transformed into a sympathetic figure in his *Josef Montfort*. But
the question of these secret powers brings us back again to the
realm of animism. It is her intuition that he possesses secret
power of this kind that makes Mephistopheles so uncanny to the
pious Gretchen.

> “She divines that I am certainly a spirit,  
> even the devil himself perchance.”[^20]

The uncanny effect of epilepsy and of madness has the same
origin. The ordinary person sees in them the workings of forces
hitherto unsuspected in his fellow-man but which at the same time
he is dimly aware of in a remote corner of his own being. The
Middle Ages quite consistently ascribed all such maladies to
daemonic influences, and in this their psychology was not so far
out. Indeed, I should not be surprised to hear that
psychoanalysis, which concerned with laying bare these hidden
forces, has itself become uncanny to many people for that very
reason. In one case, after I had succeeded—though none too
rapidly—in effecting a cure which had lasted many years in a girl
who had been an invalid, the patient’s own mother confessed to
this attitude long after the girl’s recovery.

Dismembered limbs, a severed head, a hand cut off at the
wrist,^[Cf. a fairy-tale of Hauff’s.] feet which dance by
themselves^[As in Schaeffer’s book mentioned above.]—all these
have something peculiarly uncanny about them, especially when, as
in the last instance, they prove able to move of themselves in
addition. As we already know, this kind of uncanniness springs
from its association with the castration-complex. To many people
the idea of being buried alive while appearing to be dead is the
most uncanny thing of all. And yet psychoanalysis has taught us
that this terrifying phantasy is only a transformation of another
phantasy which had originally nothing terrifying about it at all,
but was filled with a certain lustful pleasure—the phantasy, I
mean, of intra-uterine existence.

******

There is one more point of general application I should like to
add, though, strictly speaking, it has been included in our
statements about animism and mechanisms in the mind that have
been surmounted; for I think it deserves special mention. This is
that an uncanny effect is often and easily produced by effacing
the distinction between imagination and reality, such as when
something that we have hitherto regarded as imaginary appears
before us in reality, or when a symbol takes over the full
functions and significance of the thing it symbolizes, and so on.
It is this element which contributes not a little to the uncanny
effect attaching to magical practices. The infantile element in
this, which also holds sway in the minds of neurotics, is the
over-accentuation of psychical reality in comparison with
physical reality—a feature closely allied to the belief in the
omnipotence of thoughts. In the midst of the isolation of
war-time a number of the English *Strand Magazine* fell into my
hands; and, amongst other not very interesting matter, I read a
story about a young married couple, who move into a furnished
flat in which there is a curiously shaped table with carvings of
crocodiles on it. Towards evening they begin to smell an
intolerable and very typical odour that pervades the whole flat;
things begin to get in their way and trip them up in the
darkness; they seem to see a vague form gliding up the stairs—in
short, we are given to understand that the presence of the table
causes ghostly crocodiles to haunt the place, or that the wooden
monsters come to life in the dark, or something of that sort. It
was a thoroughly silly story, but the uncanny feeling it produced
was quite remarkable.

To conclude this collection of examples, which is certainly not
complete, I will relate an instance taken from psychoanalytical
experience; if it does not rest upon mere coincidence, it
furnishes a beautiful confirmation of our theory of the uncanny.
It often happens that male patients declare that they feel there
is something uncanny about the female genital organs. This
*unheimlich* place, however, is the entrance to the former *heim*
[home] of all human beings, to the place where everyone dwelt
once upon a time and in the beginning. There is a humorous
saying: “Love is home-sickness”; and whenever a man dreams of a
place or a country and says to himself, still in the dream, “this
place is familiar to me, I have been there before,” we may
interpret the place as being his mother’s genitals or her body.
In this case, too, the *unheimlich* is what was once *heimisch*,
homelike, familiar; the prefix ‘‘un’’ is the token of repression.

## Ⅲ ##

Having followed the discussion as far as this the reader will
have felt certain doubts arising in his mind about much that has
been said; and he must now have an opportunity of collecting them
and bringing them forward.

It may be true that the uncanny is nothing else than a hidden,
familiar thing that has undergone repression and then emerged
from it, and that everything that is uncanny fulfils this
condition. But these factors do not solve the problem of the
uncanny. For our proposition is clearly not convertible. Not
everything that fulfils this condition—not everything that is
connected with repressed desires and archaic forms of thought
belonging to the past of the individual and of the race—is
therefore uncanny.

Nor would we, moreover, conceal the fact that for almost every
example adduced in support of our hypothesis some other analogous
one may be found which rebuts it. The story of the severed hand
in Hauff’s fairy-tale certainly has an uncanny effect, and we
have derived that effect from the castration-complex. But in the
story in Herodotus of the treasure of Rhampsenitus, where the
master-thief leaves his brother’s severed hand behind him in that
of the princess who wants to hold him fast, most readers will
agree with me that the episode has no trace of uncanniness.
Again, the instant fulfillment of the king’s wishes in “The Ring
of Polycrates” undoubtedly does affect us in the same uncanny way
as it did the king of Egypt. Yet our own fairy-tales are crammed
with instantaneous wish-fulfillments which produce no uncanny
effect whatever. In the story of “The Three Wishes,” the woman is
tempted by the savoury smell of a sausage to wish that she might
have one too, and immediately it lies on a plate before her. In
his annoyance at her forwardness her husband wishes it may hang
on her nose. And there it is, dangling from her nose. All this,
is very vivid but not in the least uncanny. Fairy-tales quite
frankly adopt the animistic standpoint of the omnipotence of
thoughts and wishes, and yet I cannot think of any genuine
fairy-story which has anything uncanny about it. We have heard
that it is in the highest degree uncanny when inanimate objects—a
picture or a doll—come to life; nevertheless in Hans Andersen’s
stories the household utensils, furniture and tin soldiers are
alive and nothing could perhaps be more remote from the uncanny.
And we should hardly call it uncanny when Pygmalion’s beautiful
statue comes to life.

Catalepsy and the re-animation of the dead have been represented
as most uncanny themes. But things of this sort again are very
common in fairy-stories. Who would be so bold as to call it an
uncanny moment, for instance, when Snow-White opens her eyes once
more? And the resuscitation of the dead in miracles, as in the
New Testament, elicits feelings quite unrelated to the uncanny.
Then the theme that achieves such an indubitably uncanny effect,
the involuntary recurrence of the like, serves, too, other and
quite different purposes in another class of cases. One case we
have already heard about in which it is employed to call forth a
feeling of the comic; and we could multiply instances of this
kind. Or again, it works as a means of emphasis, and so on.
Another consideration is this: whence come the uncanny influences
of silence, darkness and solitude? Do not these factors point to
the part played by danger in the aetiology of what is uncanny,
notwithstanding that they are also the most frequent
accompaniment of the expression of fear in infancy? And are we in
truth justified in entirely ignoring intellectual uncertainty as
a factor, seeing that we have admitted its importance in relation
to death?

It is evident that we must be prepared to admit that there are
other elements besides those set down here determining the
production of uncanny feelings. We might say that these
preliminary results have satisfied psychoanalytic interest in the
problem of the uncanny, and that what remains probably calls for
an aesthetic valuation. But that would be to open the door to
doubts about the exact value of our general contention that the
uncanny proceeds from something familiar which has been
repressed.

One thing we may observe which may help us to resolve these
uncertainties: nearly all the instances which contradict our
hypothesis are taken from the realm of fiction and literary
productions. This may suggest a possible differentiation between
the uncanny that is actually experienced, and the uncanny as we
merely picture it or read about it.

Something uncanny in *real experience* is conditioned much more
simply, but is limited to much fewer occasions. We shall find, I
think, that it fits in perfectly with our attempt at solution,
and can be traced back without exception to something familiar
that has been repressed. But here, too, we must make a certain
important and psychologically significant differentiation in our
material, best illustrated by turning to suitable examples.

Let us take the uncanny in connection with the omnipotence of
thoughts, instantaneous wish-fulfillments, secret power to do
harm and the return of the dead. The condition under which the
feeling of uncanniness arises here is unmistakable. We—or our
primitive forefathers—once believed in the possibility of these
things and were convinced that they really happened. Nowadays we
no longer believe in them, we have *surmounted* such ways of
thought; but we do not feel quite sure of our new set of beliefs,
and the old ones still exist within us ready to seize upon any
confirmation. As soon as something actually happens in our lives
which seems to support the old, discarded beliefs, we get a
feeling of the uncanny; and it is as though we were making a
judgment something like this: “So, after all, it is true that one
can kill a person by merely desiring his death!” or, “Then the
dead do continue to live and appear before our eyes on the scene
of their former activities!”, and so on. And conversely, he who
has completely and finally dispelled animistic beliefs in
himself, will be insensible to this type of the uncanny. The most
remarkable coincidences of desire and fulfillment, the most
mysterious recurrence of similar experiences in a particular
place or on a particular date, the most deceptive sights and
suspicious noises—none of these things will take him in or raise
that kind of fear which can be described as “a fear of something
uncanny.” For the whole matter is one of “testing reality,” pure
and simple, a question of the material reality of the
phenomena.[^23]

The state of affairs is somewhat different when the uncanny
proceeds from repressed infantile complexes, from the
castration-complex, womb-phantasies, etc.; but experiences which
arouse this kind of uncanny feeling are not of very frequent
occurrence in real life. Actual occurrences of the uncanny belong
for the most part to the first group; nevertheless the
distinction between the two is theoretically very important.
Where the uncanny comes from infantile complexes the question of
external reality is quite irrelevant; its place is taken by
psychical reality. What is concerned is an actual repression of
some definite material and a return of this repressed material,
not a removal of the belief in its objective reality. We might
say that in the one case what had been repressed was a particular
ideational content and in the other the belief in its physical
existence. But this last way of putting it no doubt strains the
term “repression” beyond its legitimate meaning. It would be more
correct to respect a perceptible psychological difference here,
and to say that the animistic beliefs of civilized people have
been surmounted—more or less. Our conclusion could then be stated
thus: An uncanny experience occurs either when repressed
infantile complexes have been revived by some impression, or when
the primitive beliefs we have surmounted seem once more to be
confirmed. Finally, we must not let our predilection for smooth
solution and lucid exposition blind us to the fact that these two
classes of uncanny experience are not always sharply
distinguishable. When we consider that primitive beliefs are most
intimately connected with infantile complexes, and are, in fact,
based upon them, we shall not be greatly astonished to find the
distinction often rather a hazy one.

The uncanny as it is depicted in *literature*, in stories and
imaginative productions, merits in truth a separate discussion.
To begin with, it is a much more fertile province than the
uncanny in real life, for it contains the whole of the latter and
something more besides, something that cannot be found in real
life. The distinction between what has been repressed and what
has been surmounted cannot be transposed on to the uncanny in
fiction without profound modification; for the realm of phantasy
depends for its very existence on the fact that its content is
not submitted to the reality-testing faculty. The somewhat
paradoxical result is that *in the first place a great deal that
is not uncanny in fiction would be so if it happened in real
life; and in the second place that there are many more means of
creating uncanny effects in fiction than there are in real life*.

The story-teller has this license among many others, that he can
select his world of representation so that it either coincides
with the realities we are familiar with or departs from them in
what particulars he pleases. We accept his ruling in every case.
In fairy-tales, for instance, the world of reality is left behind
from the very start, and the animistic system of beliefs is
frankly adopted. Wish-fulfillments, secret powers, omnipotence of
thoughts, animation of lifeless objects, all the elements so
common in fairy-stories, can exert no uncanny influence here;
for, as we have learnt, that feeling cannot arise unless there is
a conflict of judgement whether things which have been
“surmounted” and are regarded as incredible are not, after all,
possible; and this problem is excluded from the beginning by the
setting of the story. And thus we see that such stories as have
furnished us with most of the contradictions to our hypothesis of
the uncanny confirm the first part of our proposition—that in the
realm of fiction many things are not uncanny which would be so if
they happened in real life. In the case of the fairy-story there
are other contributory factors, which we shall briefly touch upon
later.

The story-teller can also choose a setting which, though less
imaginary than the world of fairy tales, does yet differ from the
real world by admitting superior spiritual entities such as
daemonic influences or departed spirits. So long as they remain
within their setting of poetic reality their usual attribute of
uncanniness fails to attach to such beings. The souls in Dante’s
*Inferno*, or the ghostly apparitions in *Hamlet*, *Macbeth* or *Julius
Caesar*, may be gloomy and terrible enough, but they are no more
really uncanny than is Homer’s jovial world of gods. We order our
judgement to the imaginary reality imposed on us by the writer,
and regard souls, spirits and spectres as though their existence
had the same validity in their world as our own has in the
external world. And then in this case too we are spared all trace
of the uncanny.

The situation is altered as soon as the writer pretends to move
in the world of common reality. In this case he accepts all the
conditions operating to produce uncanny feelings in real life;
and everything that would have an uncanny effect in reality has
it in his story. But in this case, too, he can increase his
effect and multiply it far beyond what could happen in reality,
by bringing about events which never or very rarely happen in
fact. He takes advantage, as it were, of our supposedly
surmounted superstitiousness; he deceives us into thinking that
he is giving us the sober truth, and then after all oversteps the
bounds of possibility. We react to his inventions as we should
have reacted to real experiences; by the time we have seen
through his trick it is already too late and the author has
achieved his object; but it must be added that his success is not
unalloyed. We retain a feeling of dissatisfaction, a kind of
grudge against the attempted deceit; I have noticed this
particularly after reading Schnitzler’s Die Weissagung and
similar stories which flirt with the supernatural. The writer has
then one more means he can use to escape our rising vexation and
at the same time to improve his chances of success. It is this,
that he should keep us in the dark for a long time about the
precise nature of the conditions he has selected for the world he
writes about, or that he should cunningly and ingeniously avoid
any definite information on the point at all throughout the book.
Speaking generally, however, we find a confirmation of the second
part of our proposition—that fiction presents more opportunities
for creating uncanny sensations than are possible in real life.

Strictly speaking, all these complications relate only to that
class of the uncanny which proceeds from forms of thought that
have been surmounted. The class which proceeds from repressed
complexes is more irrefragable and remains as powerful in fiction
as in real experience, except in one point. The uncanny belonging
to the first class— that proceeding from forms of thought that
have been surmounted—retains this quality in fiction as in
experience so long as the setting is one of physical reality; but
as soon as it is given an arbitrary and unrealistic setting in
fiction, it is apt to lose its quality of the uncanny.

It is clear that we have not exhausted the possibilities of
poetic license and the privileges enjoyed by storywriters in
evoking or in excluding an uncanny feeling. In the main we adopt
an unvarying passive attitude towards experience and are acted
upon by our physical environment. But the story-teller has a
peculiarly directive influence over us; by means of the states of
mind into which he can put us and the expectations he can rouse
in us, he is able to guide the current of our emotions, dam it up
in one direction and make it flow in another, and he often
obtains a great variety of effects from the same material. All
this is nothing new, and has doubtless long since been fully
taken into account by professors of aesthetics. We have drifted
into this field of research half involuntarily, through the
temptation to explain certain instances which contradicted our
theory of the causes of the uncanny. And accordingly we will now
return to the examination of a few instances.

We have already asked why it is that the severed hand in the
story of the treasure of Rhainpsenitus has no uncanny effect in
the way that Hauff’s story of the severed hand has. The question
seems to us to have gained in importance now that we have
recognized that class of the uncanny which proceeds from
repressed complexes to be the more durable of the two. The answer
is easy. In the Herodotus story our thoughts are concentrated
much more on the superior cunning of the master-thief than on the
feelings of the princess. The princess may well have had an
uncanny feeling, indeed she very probably fell into a swoon; but
we have no such sensations, for we put ourselves in the thief’s
place, not in hers. In Nestroy’s farce, *Der Zerrissene*, another
means is used to avoid any impression of the uncanny in the scene
in which the fleeing man, convinced that he is a murderer, lifts
up one trapdoor after another and each time sees what he takes to
be the ghost of his victim rising up out of it. He calls out in
despair, “But I’ve only killed *one* man. Why this horrid
multiplication?” We know the truth and do not share the error of
the *Zerrissener*, so what must be uncanny to him has an
irresistibly comic effect on us. Even a “real” ghost, as in Oscar
Wilde’s *Canterville Ghost*, loses all power of arousing at any
rate an uncanny horror in us as soon as the author begins to
amuse himself at its expense and allows liberties to be taken
with it. Thus we see how independent emotional effects can be of
the actual subject matter in the world of fiction. In
fairy-stories feelings of fear—including uncanny sensations—are
ruled out altogether. We understand this, and that is why we
ignore the opportunities we find for any development of a feeling
of this kind.

Concerning the factors of silence, solitude and darkness, we can
only say that they are actually elements in the production of
that infantile morbid anxiety from which the majority of human
beings have never become quite free. This problem has been
discussed from a psychoanalytical point of view in another place.

[^8]: In fact, Hoffmann’s imaginative treatment of his material
    has not played such havoc with its elements that we cannot
    reconstruct their original arrangement. In the story from
    Nathaniel’s childhood, the figures of his father and
    Coppelius represent the two opposites into which the
    father-imago is split by the ambivalence of the child’s
    feeling; whereas the one threatens to blind him, that is, to
    castrate him, the other, the loving father, intercedes for
    his sight. That part of the complex which is most strongly
    repressed, the death-wish against the father, finds
    expression in the death of the good father, and Coppelius is
    made answerable for it. Later, in his student days, Professor
    Spalanzani and Coppola the optician reproduce this double
    representation of the fatherimago, the Professor as a member
    of the father-series, Coppola openly identified with the
    lawyer Coppelius. Just as before they used to work together
    over the fire, so now they have jointly created the doll
    Olympia; the Professor is even called the father of Olympia.
    This second occurrence of work in common shows that the
    optician and the mechanincian are also components of the
    father-imago, that is, both are Nathaniel’s father as well as
    Olympia’s. I ought to have added that in the terrifying scene
    in childhood, Coppelius, after sparing Nathaniel’s eyes, had
    screwed off his arms and legs as an experiment; that is, he
    had experimented on him as a mechanician would on a doll.
    This singular feature, which seems quite out of perspective
    in the picture of the Sand-Man, introduces a new
    castration-equivalent; but it also emphasizes the identity of
    Coppelius and his later counterpart, Spalanzani the
    mechanician, and helps us to understand who Olympia is. She,
    the automatic doll, can be nothing else than a
    personification of Nathaniel’s feminine attitude towards his
    father in his infancy. The father of both, Spalanzani and
    Coppola, are, as we know, new editions, reincarnations of
    Nathaniel’s “two” fathers. Now Spalaazani’s otherwise
    incomprehensible statement that the optician has stolen
    Nathaniel’s eyes so as to set them in the doll becomes
    significant and supplies fresh evidence for the identity of
    Olympia and Nathaniel. Olympia is, as it were, a dissociated
    complex of Nathaniel’s which confronts him as a person, and
    Nathaniel’s enslavement to this complex is expressed in his
    senseless obsessive love for Olympia. We may with justice
    call such love narcissistic, and can understand why he who
    has fallen victim to it should relinquish his real, external
    object of love. The psychological truth of the situation in
    which the young man, fixated upon his father by his
    castration-complex, is incapable of loving a woman, is amply
    proved by numerous analyses of patients whose story, though
    less fantastic, is hardly less tragic than that of the
    student Nathaniel.

    Hoffmann was the child of an unhappy marriage. When he was three
    years old, his father left his small family, never to be united to them
    again. According to Grisebach, in his biographical introduction to
    Hoffmann’s works, the writer’s relation to his father was always a most
    sensitive subject with him.

[^23]: Since the uncanny effect of a “double” also belongs to
    this class, it is interesting to observe what the effect is
    of suddenly and unexpectedly meeting one’s own image. E. Mach
    has related two such observations in his *Analyse der Em
    findungen* (1900, p. 3). On the first occasion he started
    violently as soon as he realized that the face before him was
    his own. The second time he formed a very unfavorable opinion
    about the supposed stranger who got into the omnibus, and
    thought “What a shabby-looking school-master that is getting
    in now.”—I can supply a similar experience. I was sitting
    alone in my *wagon-lit* compartment when a more than usually
    violent jerk of the train swung back the door of the
    adjoining washing-cabinet, and an elderly gentleman in a
    dressing-gown and a traveling cap came in. I assumed that he
    had been about to leave the washing-cabinet which divides the
    two compartments, and had taken the wrong direction and come
    into my compartment by mistake. Jumping up with the intention
    of putting him right, I at once realized to my dismay that
    the intruder was nothing but my own reflection in the
    looking-glass of the open door. I can still recollect that I
    thoroughly disliked his appearance. Instead, therefore, of
    being terrified by our doubles, both Mach and I simply failed
    to recognize them as such. Is it not possible, though, that
    our dislike of them was a vestigial trace of that older
    reaction which feels the double to be something uncanny?
